Assessment
==========


Introduction
------------

At its core, OASIS is a tool for presenting questions to students, and marking
their answers. While the primary focus is on practice, it is easy to deliver
the questions as an "assessment", where the student has a selection of
questions to answer, and a time period in which to answer them.


Types of Assessment
-------------------

The two main types of assessment supported are "Exams" and "Assignments". Exams
are intended to be run supervised, from a computer lab, and assignments model
take-home paper assignments.
