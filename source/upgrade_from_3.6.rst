Upgrade from OASIS 3.6 to 3.9.6
===============================

OASIS has had some significant changes between version 3.6 and 3.9, so an in-place
upgrade is not recommended.

Instead, setup the new OASIS on a different server and copy the database
across. This also has the advantage of leaving the previous installation intact
until you feel ready to switch to the new one.


1. Install OASIS 3.9.6 according to :doc:`installation`
2. Use the :doc:`admin_oasisdb` to do the migration
