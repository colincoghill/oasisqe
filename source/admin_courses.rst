Course Administration
=====================

A Course in OASIS is a collection of *content* - questions and assessments,
and groups of *people* - students and staff.


Creating a Course
-----------------

To start with, we'll create a simple course that users can enrol themselves into. This
doesn't require setting up integration with external systems, so is a good place to start.

#. As the administrator user, log in to OASIS and from the main menu select the **Setup** page.
