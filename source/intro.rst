Introduction
==============

The "OASIS" Online Assessment system was developed by The University of Auckland, New Zealand, to assist in the teaching of large undergraduate engineering courses. The original system began in 1998, but it has been updated over time. We gained permission to release the code as Open Source, but lacked the resources to do so properly. Several other groups have taken the OASIS code to try it themselves, however.

In 2012 it became clear that the code needed some work - it is still very successful and we've still been unable to find anything else that does its job - to bring it up to modern security standards, with a more palatable look and feel.

I have taken the OASIS v3.6 code base, developed mostly in 2001-2004 (by me), and gone through, removing old components, refreshing the look and feel, and fixing security issues. This has been a major piece of work, requiring a rewrite of approximately 1/3 of the code.

The plan is to release this code as a series of OSS releases, as I get enough features of the original system active to be useful to other people.

This code has been developed mostly under the auspices of The University of Auckland, and is used successfully by us. The University does not, however, otherwise endorse it or commit to any support of other users.
